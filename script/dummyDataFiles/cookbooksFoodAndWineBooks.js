      'Now a Netflix series!\nNew York Times Bestseller and Winner of the 2018 James Beard Award for Best General Cookbook and multiple IACP Cookbook Awards\nNamed one of the Best Books of 2017 by: NPR, BuzzFeed, The Atlantic, The Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Rachel Ray Every Day, San Francisco Chronicle, Vice Munchies, Elle.com, Glamour, Eater, Newsday, Minneapolis Star Tribune, The Seattle Times, Tampa Bay Times, Tasting Table, Modern Farmer, Publishers Weekly, and more.\nA visionary new master class in cooking that distills decades of professional experience into just four simple elements, from the woman declared “America’s next great cooking teacher” by Alice Waters.\nIn the tradition of The Joy of Cooking and How to Cook Everything comes Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, an ambitious new approach to cooking by a major new culinary voice. Chef and writer Samin Nosrat has taught everyone from professional chefs to middle school kids to author Michael Pollan to cook using her revolutionary, yet simple, philosophy. Master the use of just four elements—Salt, which enhances flavor; Fat, which delivers flavor and generates texture; Acid, which balances flavor; and Heat, which ultimately determines the texture of food—and anything you cook will be delicious. By explaining the hows and whys of good cooking, Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat will teach and inspire a new generation of cooks how to confidently make better decisions in the kitchen and cook delicious meals with any ingredients, anywhere, at any time.\nEchoing Samin’s own journey from culinary novice to award-winning chef, Salt, Fat Acid, Heat immediately bridges the gap between home and professional kitchens. With charming narrative, illustrated walkthroughs, and a lighthearted approach to kitchen science, Samin demystifies the four elements of good cooking for everyone. Refer to the canon of 100 essential recipes—and dozens of variations—to put the lessons into practice and make bright, balanced vinaigrettes, perfectly caramelized roast vegetables, tender braised meats, and light, flaky pastry doughs.\nFeaturing 150 illustrations and infographics that reveal an atlas to the world of flavor by renowned illustrator Wendy MacNaughton, Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat will be your compass in the kitchen. Destined to be a classic, it just might be the last cookbook you’ll ever need.\nWith a foreword by Michael Pollan.'

Too often, doctors tell us that these discomforts are to be expected and that we will have to wait them out during “the change”; some of us even agree to be unnecessarily medicated. But Dr. Anna Cabeca’s research and experience with thousands of her patients show that there is a fast-acting and nonpharmaceutical way to dramatically and permanently alleviate these symptoms.\nThe Hormone Fix introduces Dr. Cabeca’s unique Keto-Green protocol, a plan that pairs the hallmarks of ketogenic (low-carb/high fat) eating with diet and lifestyle changes that bring the body’s cellular pH to a healthy alkaline level. The proven result: balanced cortisol and reduced output of insulin, the hormones most responsible for belly fat and weight gain, plus an increase in oxytocin, the “love and happiness” hormone. Whether you are perimenopausal, menopausal, or postmenopausal, The Hormone Fix offers an easy-to-follow program, including\n• a 10-day quick-start detox diet to jump-start weight loss and reduce symptoms immediately\n• daily meal plans and weekly shopping lists to take the guesswork out of a month’s worth of Keto-Green eating\n• 65 delicious and easy-to-make recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, smoothies, and soups\n• detailed information on vitamin and mineral supplementation that optimizes hormone balance\n• simple self-assessments and recommended optional lab testing for a better understanding of your hormonal status\n• tested and trusted stress-reduction and oxytocin-amplifying advice and techniques\nWith The Hormone Fix you can expect to trim down, tap into new and unexpected energy levels, enhance intimacy, and completely revitalize your life! Ready for your fix?\nAdvance praise for The Hormone Fix\n“The Hormone Fix is a treasure trove of accurate and user-friendly information that all women who are suffering during menopause need to know and apply.”—Christiane Northrup, MD, author of The Wisdom of Menopause'

      "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER\nEvicted meets Nickel and Dimed in Stephanie Land's memoir about working as a maid, a beautiful and gritty exploration of poverty in America. Includes a foreword by Barbara Ehrenreich.\nAt 28, Stephanie Land's plans of breaking free from the roots of her hometown in the Pacific Northwest to chase her dreams of attending a university and becoming a writer, were cut short when a summer fling turned into an unexpected pregnancy. She turned to housekeeping to make ends meet, and with a tenacious grip on her dream to provide her daughter the very best life possible, Stephanie worked days and took classes online to earn a college degree, and began to write relentlessly.\nShe wrote the true stories that weren't being told: the stories of overworked and underpaid Americans. Of living on food stamps and WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) coupons to eat. Of the government programs that provided her housing, but that doubled as halfway houses. The aloof government employees who called her lucky for receiving assistance while she didn't feel lucky at all. She wrote to remember the fight, to eventually cut through the deep-rooted stigmas of the working poor.\nMaid explores the underbelly of upper-middle class America and the reality of what it's like to be in service to them. \"I'd become a nameless ghost,\" Stephanie writes about her relationship with her clients, many of whom do not know her from any other cleaner, but who she learns plenty about. As she begins to discover more about her clients' lives-their sadness and love, too-she begins to find hope in her own path.\nHer compassionate, unflinching writing as a journalist gives voice to the \"servant\" worker, and those pursuing the American Dream from below the poverty line. Maid is Stephanie's story, but it's not her alone. It is an inspiring testament to the strength, determination, and ultimate triumph of the human spirit."

      '#1 New Release, #1 Best Seller. Stephanie Laska lost 140 pounds, roughly half of her body weight, by following a ketogenic inspired diet. She figured out the secret to losing weight without the crazy restrictions of a traditional keto diet by following a "dirty" and "lazy" version of keto.\nStephanie spent most of her adult life in the Morbidly Obese Class III BMI category. Hovering close to 300 pounds, she avoided booths at restaurants and feared not fitting into amusement park rides. "I once hid my jacket over my lap so the flight attendant wouldn\'t see that my seatbelt wouldn\'t close," she admits.\nIt wasn\'t until a friend suggested she could continue to drink beer while still losing weight that Stephanie decided to "try one last time". Any diet that included loopholes for having a cold beer might be worth a try, she reflected.\nThrough trial and error, Stephanie learned how eating a low carb, moderate protein, higher fat diet could finally nudge her weight in the right direction. "This is the weirdest diet ever!" went through her mind every time she got on the scale. Coming from an era of eating FruitLoops© washed down with a pitcher of Kool-Aid©, Stephanie was clueless about the metabolic effects of consuming too many carbohydrates.\nDIRTY, LAZY, KETO explains the unique diet Stephanie followed to achieve her success. Using humor and simple explanations, Stephanie walks the reader through her personal manifesto for weight loss and maintenance, with helpful strategies and food lists to immediately employ.\nStephanie has kept her weight off for six years! She left behind a giant dent on the couch to run twelve marathons, two of which earned her a first-place marathon medal. As part of the chosen "Clean Start Team", Stephanie ran the New York City Marathon in 2017 as a sponsored athlete from PowerBar©. Her story even appeared in the international publication, Muscle and Fitness: HERS, Spring 2018. More recently, Costco Connection Magazine shared Stephanie\'s story in an article about the merits of an anti-inflammatory diet (January 2019).\nStephanie\'s hope is that the reader will leave inspired and armed with enough information to get started on their own journey of personalized weight loss success.\nLet\'s discuss the goals of this down and dirty mini-guide. By the end, the reader will be able to:\n*Partner with your physician to set realistic goals based on your current health\n*Understand the difference between a DIRTY, LAZY, KETO diet and a Ketogenic Diet\n*Accurately read a nutrition label and count the net carbs per serving\n*Confidently shop for ingredients that you need to be successful\n*Stock your fridge and pantry with appropriate foods for cooking and snacking\n*Prepare quick and easy meals, drinks, snacks, and desserts that are on plan\n*Strategize ways to prevent dehydration\n*Recognize and stop efforts at self-sabotage\n*Have a long-term plan for healthy, sustainable weight loss\nThere are plenty of keto-type cookbooks on the market, and this IS NOT one of them! DIRTY, LAZY, KETO Getting Started: How I Lost 140 Pounds is full of inspiration, "how to", and practical advice for losing weight. You don\'t need a meal plan when you figure out how to eat every day foods from your own kitchen that keep you in ketosis.\nStephanie Laska gives you the keto basics, but without the keto police. Dirty keto? Lazy keto? This book gives you permission to make a ketogenic inspired diet work for you!'

      '#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A panoramic experience that tells the story of Beastie Boys, a book as unique as the band itself—by band members ADROCK and Mike D, with contributions from Amy Poehler, Colson Whitehead, Spike Jonze, Wes Anderson, Luc Sante, and more.\nNAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY Rolling Stone • The Guardian • Paste\nFormed as a New York City hardcore band in 1981, Beastie Boys struck an unlikely path to global hip hop superstardom. Here is their story, told for the first time in the words of the band. Adam “ADROCK” Horovitz and Michael “Mike D” Diamond offer revealing and very funny accounts of their transition from teenage punks to budding rappers; their early collaboration with Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin; the debut album that became the first hip hop record ever to hit #1, Licensed to Ill—and the album’s messy fallout as the band broke with Def Jam; their move to Los Angeles and rebirth with the genre-defying masterpiece Paul’s Boutique; their evolution as musicians and social activists over the course of the classic albums Check Your Head, Ill Communication, and Hello Nasty and the Tibetan Freedom Concert benefits conceived by the late Adam “MCA” Yauch; and more. For more than thirty years, this band has had an inescapable and indelible influence on popular culture.\nWith a style as distinctive and eclectic as a Beastie Boys album, Beastie Boys Book upends the typical music memoir. Alongside the band narrative you will find rare photos, original illustrations, a cookbook by chef Roy Choi, a graphic novel, a map of Beastie Boys’ New York, mixtape playlists, pieces by guest contributors, and many more surprises.\nPraise for Beastie Boys Book\n“A fascinating, generous book with portraits and detail that float by in bursts of color . . . As with [the band’s] records, the book’s structure is a lyrical three-man weave. . . . Diamond’s voice is lapidary, droll. Horovitz comes on like a borscht belt comedian, but beneath that he is urgent, incredulous, kind of vulnerable. . . . Friendship is the book’s subject as much as music, fame and New York.”—The New York Times Book Review\n“Wild, moving . . . resembles a Beastie Boys LP in its wild variety of styles.”—Rolling Stone\n“As nutty, irreverent, and fun as you think it would be.”—Vogue\n“As freewheeling and funny as their albums . . . a beautifully messy (and large) talisman containing within it many of the great joys and surprises that come with listening to the Beastie Boys”—The AV Club'

      'Beloved food blogger and New York Times bestselling author Danielle Walker is back with over 100 new Paleo recipes in her sophomore cookbook, Meals Made Simple—a collection of gluten-free, dairy-free, and Paleo-friendly recipes for easy weeknight meals.\nDiagnosed with an autoimmune disease at twenty-two, Danielle Walker spent many years in and out of the hospital and on high dosages of debilitating medications before taking her health into her own hands and drastically changing her diet. In a true lemons-to-lemonade story, Danielle transformed her adversities into opportunities and created her wildly successful blog, Against All Grain, in an effort to help those in need eat well and feel great, without feeling deprived.\nWith recipes that make cooking for the grain-free family both easy and enjoyable, Meals Made Simple answers the age-old question: “What’s for dinner?” Danielle Walker takes the guesswork out of meal planning with eight weeks’ worth of dinner ideas, complete with full shopping lists and recipes for using up leftovers. Whether we’re moms, students, or business owners, at the end of the day we all want fresh, home-cooked meals that are easy to prepare. And we want lots of variety.\nPreparing real foods can be time-consuming and monotonous, but Danielle brings both simplicity and creativity to the everyday meal with an enthusiasm for flavors and textures that are often lacking in easy weeknight dishes.

      "Get the best possible results from your air fryer and discover the best ways to use it (not just frying!) with 75 fast, convenient, great-tasting recipes.\nAir fryers promise crisp fried food without actual deep frying. Was it too good to be believed? And what can you cook in them besides French fries? In truth, air fryers cook food by blasting it with circulated hot air. The method is fast, convenient, and can be surprisingly good--if you have right recipe. We cooked more than 70 pounds of potatoes to create the perfect air fryer French fry, with an evenly crisp exterior and creamy center. But what really drew us to this appliance was the variety of what you can make in it, effortlessly and without having to enlist numerous pots and pans.\nIn addition to crispy fried chicken and fries, you'll turn out evenly cooked steaks, such as Spice-Rubbed Steak with Snap Pea and Cucumber Salad (the spice rub gives them a bold crust), Sweet and Smoky Pork Tenderloin with Roasted Butternut Squash (the pork cooks directly on top of the squash to save time), and Tandoori Chicken Thighs. Many of the recipes yield both a main and a side for a complete meal. Most recipes take only 45 minutes or even less time, and all come with complete nutrition information.\nFrozen foods cook up crisp in the air fryer, but the results are so much better when you start with homemade. So we offer freeze-it-yourself Chicken Nuggets, Southwestern Beef Hand Pies, and more that go straight from freezer to air fryer and cook to perfection. And we share plenty of kid-friendly meals and snacks, from Better-Than-Boxed Fish Sticks to Zucchini Fries."

Going “keto” by eating high fat, low-to-moderate protein and low-carb foods enables you to break free from the disastrous effects of carbohydrate dependency by resetting your metabolism and promoting metabolic flexibility—where your body learns to burns fat instead of sugar for energy, even when you go off plan.\nUnlike many other ketogenic programs that require challenging restrictions and deprivation or offer misinformation, Mark Sisson, bestselling author of The Primal Blueprint and publisher of the #1 paleo blog MarksDailyApple.com, presents a unique two-step, scientifically validated approach for going keto the right way. He first reveals the real secret to rapid and sustained weight loss, which is in becoming "fat-adapted" before entering full nutritional ketosis. This process allows your body to learn to burn fat more efficiently, resulting in increased and sustained weight loss over the long-term. It takes as little as 21-days to reprogram your metabolism to burn fat for fuel, by ditching processed grains, sugars, and refined vegetable oils in favor of nutrient-dense, high fat, primal/paleo foods--and you\'ll see immediate results. Next, you’ll fine-tune with Intermittent Fasting and then foray into full ketogenic eating for a further weight loss boost and improved health.\nWith The Keto Reset Diet, you can eat to total satisfaction by enjoying rich, high-satiety foods, and even weather occasional slip-ups. You’ll use keto as a lifelong tool to stay trim, healthy, energetic, and free from the disastrous health conditions caused by the typical American diet. With step-by-step guidance, daily meal plans and a recipe section with over 100 delicious keto-friendly recipes, this is the definitive guide to help the keto-beginner or the experienced health enthusiast understand the what, why, and how to succeed with ketogenic eating.'

This debut cookbook is about Matty’s memories of the foods that have defined who he is. With a drive to share his zest for life, he creates dishes within these pages that reinterpret the flavors of his youth in Canada, as well as the restaurant fare for which he has become so well-known. Interpretations of classics like Seafood Chowder, Scumbo: Dad’s Gumbo, and Rappie Pie appear alongside restaurant recipes like Bavette, Pigtail Tacos, and his infamous P&L Burger. This is a very personal cookbook, full of essays and headnotes that share Matty’s life—from growing up in Fort Erie, exploring the wonders of Prince Edward Island, struggling and learning as a young chef in Toronto, and, eventually, his rise to popularity as one of the world’s most recognizable food personalities. His no-nonsense approach to food makes these recipes practical enough for all, while his creativity will entice seasoned cooks.

      'This is the classic cookbook, in its entirety—all 524 recipes.\n“Anyone can cook in the French manner anywhere,” wrote Mesdames Beck, Bertholle, and Child, “with the right instruction.” And here is the book that, for more than forty years, has been teaching Americans how.\nMastering the Art of French Cooking is for both seasoned cooks and beginners who love good food and long to reproduce at home the savory delights of the classic cuisine, from the historic Gallic masterpieces to the seemingly artless perfection of a dish of spring-green peas. This beautiful book, with more than 100 instructive illustrations, is revolutionary in its approach because:\n• it leads the cook infallibly from the buying and handling of raw ingredients, through each essential step of a recipe, to the final creation of a delicate confection;\n• it breaks down the classic cuisine into a logical sequence of themes and variations rather than presenting an endless and diffuse catalogue of recipes; the focus is on key recipes that form the backbone of French cookery and lend themselves to an infinite number of elaborations—bound to increase anyone’s culinary repertoire;\n• it adapts classical techniques, wherever possible, to modern American conveniences;\n• it shows Americans how to buy products, from any supermarket in the United States, that reproduce the exact taste and texture of the French ingredients, for example, equivalent meat cuts, the right beans for a cassoulet, or the appropriate fish and seafood for a bouillabaisse;\n• it offers suggestions for just the right accompaniment to each dish, including proper wines.\nSince there has never been a book as instructive and as workable as Mastering the Art of French Cooking, the techniques learned here can be applied to recipes in all other French cookbooks, making them infinitely more usable. In compiling the secrets of famous cordons bleus, the authors have produced a magnificent volume that is sure to find the place of honor in every kitchen in America. Bon appétit!'

Once you understand the hows and whys of each "family," you\'ll understand why some cocktails work and others don\'t, when to shake and when to stir, what you can omit and what you can substitute when you\'re missing ingredients, why you like the drinks you do, and what sorts of drinks you should turn to--or invent--if you want to try something new.'

That may sound intimidating, but the technique has trickled down from experimental fine-dining restaurant kitchens to the home kitchen precisely because it\'s an easy, convenient, and hands-off way to cook. Sous vide not only makes traditional cooking easier and more foolproof, it often can help to make food taste better, taking away all the guesswork and giving you back some free time. In this cookbook, you will find recipes that teach you how to cook sous vide, starting with basics like the perfect steak or soft-cooked egg. You will also find recipes that expand your knowledge and creativity in the kitchen using sous vide, from a holiday-worthy chuck roast that tastes like a prime rib at a fraction of the cost to eggs Benedict to fruit-on-the-bottom yogurt cups.'

After years racking up culinary cred at New York City restaurants like Lupa, Momofuku, and Blue Hill, he managed the trailblazing Four Season Farm in coastal Maine, where he developed an appreciation for every part of the plant and learned to coax the best from vegetables at each stage of their lives.\nIn Six Seasons, his first book, McFadden channels both farmer and chef, highlighting the evolving attributes of vegetables throughout their growing seasons—an arc from spring to early summer to midsummer to the bursting harvest of late summer, then ebbing into autumn and, finally, the earthy, mellow sweetness of winter. Each chapter begins with recipes featuring raw vegetables at the start of their season. As weeks progress, McFadden turns up the heat—grilling and steaming, then moving on to sautés, pan roasts, braises, and stews. His ingenuity is on display in 225 revelatory recipes that celebrate flavor at its peak.'

Within three years, her back and stomach muscles had weakened to the point where she needed a tilt-recline wheelchair. Conventional medical treatments were failing her, and she feared that she would be bedridden for the rest of her life.\nDr. Wahls began studying the latest research on autoimmune disease and brain biology, and decided to get her vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids from the food she ate rather than pills and supplements. Dr. Wahls adopted the nutrient-rich paleo diet, gradually refining and integrating it into a regimen of neuromuscular stimulation. First, she walked slowly, then steadily, and then she biked eighteen miles in a single day. In November 2011, Dr. Wahls shared her remarkable recovery in a TEDx talk that immediately went viral. Now, in The Wahls Protocol, she shares the details of the protocol that allowed her to reverse many of her symptoms, get back to her life, and embark on a new mission: to share the Wahls Protocol with others suffering from the ravages of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune conditions.'

      "The bestselling Joy of Cooking—the book Julia Child called “a fundamental resource for any American cook”—now in a revised and updated 75th Anniversary edition, which restores the voice of the original authors and many of the most beloved recipes from past editions and includes quick, healthy recipes for the way we cook today. JOY is a timeless kitchen essential for this generation and the next.\nA St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking in 1931. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment.\nToday, nine revisions later, the Joy of Cooking—selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century—has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.\nEthan Becker, Marion's son, led the latest version of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with the seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were “stand facing the stove.” Recently, Ethan’s son, John Becker, and John’s wife, Megan Scott, joined the JOY team, where they oversee the brand’s website (TheJoyKitchen.com) and all social media for JOY. They spearheaded the creation of the bestselling Joy of Cooking app, available for iPhone and iPad.\nJOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.\nThe 75th Anniversary edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.\nThis edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.\nIn addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.\nThis is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes—abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.\nAs always, JOY grows with the times: The 75th Anniversary edition of JOY boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion—always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.\nThis all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.\nThe span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.\nHappy Anniversary, JOY! Happy Cooking."

      'The first 40 days after the birth of a child offer an essential and fleeting period of rest and recovery for the new mother. Based on author Heng Ou’s own postpartum experience with zuo yuezi, a set period of “confinement,” in which a woman remains at home focusing on healing and bonding with her baby, The First Forty Days revives the lost art of caring for the mother after birth.\nAs modern mothers are pushed to prematurely “bounce back” after deliver­ing their babies, and are often left alone to face the physical and emotional challenges of this new stage of their lives, the first forty days provide a lifeline—a source of connection, nourishment, and guidance.\nThe book includes 60 simple recipes for healing soups; replenishing meals and snacks; and calming and lactation-boosting teas, all formulated to support the unique needs of the new mother. In addition to the recipes, this warm and encouraging guide offers advice on arranging a system of help during the post­partum period, navigating relationship challenges, and honoring the significance of pregnancy and birth.\nThe First Forty Days, fully illustrated to feel both inspiring and soothing, is a practical guide and inspirational read for all new mothers and mothers-to-be—the perfect ally during the first weeks with a new baby.'

      "A pick in Amazon's Cookbooks, Food & Wine Best Books of February category\nOne of Booklist's Must Read Nonfiction picks of 2019\nThe acclaimed author of A Replacement Life shifts between heartbreak and humor in this gorgeously told, recipe-filled memoir. A family story, an immigrant story, a love story, and an epic meal, Savage Feast explores the challenges of navigating two cultures from an unusual angle.\nA revealing personal story and family memoir told through meals and recipes, Savage Feast begins with Boris’s childhood in Soviet Belarus, where good food was often worth more than money. He describes the unlikely dish that brought his parents together and how years of Holocaust hunger left his grandmother so obsessed with bread that she always kept five loaves on hand. She was the stove magician and Boris’ grandfather the master black marketer who supplied her, evading at least one firing squad on the way. These spoils kept Boris’ family—Jews who lived under threat of discrimination and violence—provided-for and protected.\nDespite its abundance, food becomes even more important in America, which Boris’ family reaches after an emigration through Vienna and Rome filled with marvel, despair, and bratwurst. How to remain connected to one’s roots while shedding their trauma? The ambrosial cooking of Oksana, Boris’s grandfather’s Ukrainian home aide, begins to show him the way. His quest takes him to a farm in the Hudson River Valley, the kitchen of a Russian restaurant on the Lower East Side, a Native American reservation in South Dakota, and back to Oksana’s kitchen in Brooklyn. His relationships with women—troubled, he realizes, for reasons that go back many generations—unfold concurrently, finally bringing him, after many misadventures, to an American soulmate.\nSavage Feast is Boris’ tribute to food, that secret passage to an intimate conversation about identity, belonging, family, displacement, and love."

      "God is a foodie who wants to transform your supper into sacrament.\nOne of America's most beloved teachers and writers, Margaret Feinberg, goes on a remarkable journey to unearth God's perspective on food.\nShe writes that since the opening of creation, God, the Master Chef, seeds the world with pomegranates and passionfruit, beans and greens and tangerines. When the Israelites wander in the desert for forty years, God, the Pastry Chef, delivers the sweet bread of heaven. After arriving in the Promised Land, God reveals himself as Barbecue Master, delighting in meat sacrifices. Like his Foodie Father, Jesus throws the disciples an unforgettable two-course farewell supper to be repeated until his return.\nThis groundbreaking book provides a culinary exploration of Scripture. You'll descend 400 feet below ground into the frosty white caverns of a salt mine, fish on the Sea of Galilee, bake fresh matzo at Yale University, ferry to a remote island in Croatia to harvest olives, spend time with a Texas butcher known as \"the meat apostle,\" and wander a California farm with one of the world's premier fig farmers.\nWith each visit, Margaret asks, \"How do you read these Scriptures, not as theologians, but in light of what you do every day?\" Their answers will forever change the way you read the Bible - and approach every meal.\nTaste and See is a delicious read that includes dozens of recipes for those who, like Margaret, believe some of life's richest moments are spent savoring a meal with those you love.\nPerhaps God's foodie focus is meant to do more than satisfy our bellies. It's meant to heal our souls, as we learn to taste and see the goodness of God together. After all, food is God's love made edible.\nSee you around the table!"

If you are low carb, paleo, are wanting to keep autoimmune issues at bay, or just want to lose extra weight, Eat Happy gives you comfort food where you won’t miss the sugars or grains so your body and brain can feel happy from eating real foods.\nIn 2012, after almost ten years of being gluten free due to celiac, Anna Vocino found she was gaining weight faster than a tick on a labradoodle. Turns out the culprit wasn’t overeating or too much fat in the diet, but the pesky sugars and grains in all those gluten free comfort foods. When Anna started podcasting with Fitness Confidential author Vinnie Tortorich, she adapted her entire way of eating to go what Tortorich coined: NSNG—No Sugars No Grains. Sure enough, the weight dropped off, the inflammation due to celiac finally calmed down, and for the first time in her life, she learned what it meant to be truly happy about food.\nAll of Anna’s recipes are delicious, easy to make, and so satisfying, you won’t even know you’re eating healthy. Craving rich, decadent chocolate pots with fresh cream that are delicious but not fattening? Wanna make a grain-free pizza crust that actually helps you lose weight? Dying for pancakes, but you’ve committed to avoiding carbs? How about hearty shepherd’s pie, tater tots, sizzling ginger rice, all made with cauliflower instead of high carb rice and potatoes?

      "A Dutch oven is the most versatile pot in your kitchen: a soup pot, a deep fryer, a braiser, a roaster, an enclosed bread oven, and the perfect vessel for one-dish meals.\nDon't relegate your prized pot to the back of the cabinet. Learn how to put your Dutch oven to work every day in so many different ways. Turn out practical yet fun meals made entirely in one pot, such as Weeknight Pasta Bolognese; Chicken Pot Pie with Spring Vegetables; and Lamb Meatballs with Orzo, Tomatoes, and Feta. Impressive braises and roasts, such as Braised Short Ribs with Wild Mushroom Farrotto and Roasted Pork Loin with Barley, Butternut Squash, and Swiss Chard, go seamlessly from the stovetop (the enameled surface makes it easy to create fond without burning) to the oven (cast iron maintains steady heat to ensure food cooks perfectly). We even walk you through deep frying and artisanal bread baking at home (try the Korean Fried Chicken Wings or the Braided Chocolate Babka). And a range of appealing desserts, from Pear-Ginger Crisp (the pot holds a generous 5 pounds of pears) to Bourbon-Pecan Bread Pudding, benefit from the Dutch oven's high sides and even heating."

      'Five years ago, popular blogger Brandi Doming of The Vegan 8 became a vegan, overhauling the way she and her family ate after a health diagnosis for her husband. The effects have been life-changing. Her recipes rely on refreshingly short ingredient lists that are ideal for anyone new to plant-based cooking or seeking simplified, wholesome, family-friendly options for weeknight dinners. All of the recipes are dairy-free and most are oil-free, gluten-free, and nut-free (if not, Brandi offers suitable alternatives), and ideally tailored to meet the needs of an array of health conditions. Each of the 100 recipes uses just 8 or fewer ingredients (not including salt, pepper, or water) to create satisfying, comforting meals from breakfast to dessert that your family—even the non-vegans—will love. Try Bakery-Style Blueberry Muffins, Fool ’Em “Cream Cheese” Spinach-Artichoke Dip, Cajun Veggie and Potato Chowder, Skillet Baked Mac n’ Cheese, and No-Bake Chocolate Espresso Fudge Cake.'

Instead, with all of the incredible food you will be enjoying, you may forget that you are achieving better wellness!\nIn the first section of the book, you will learn all about the Autoimmune Protocol--what it is, why it works, and which foods you should eat and avoid while on the elimination diet. Instructions are given on how to clear your pantry of questionable ingredients and replace them with healing, nutrient-dense whole foods.

Mickey provides two, 4-week meal plans, each of them corresponding with recipes from the book and featuring detailed shopping lists.
